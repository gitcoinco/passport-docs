# Introducing Gitcoin Passport

Gitcoin Passport is an identity verification application. It enables you to collect [verifiable credentials](https://decentralized-id.com/web-standards/w3c/wg/vc/verifiable-credentials/) that prove your identity and trustworthiness without exposing personally identifying information. Apps and organizations can then use your Passport to coordinate your rights and responsibilities.
